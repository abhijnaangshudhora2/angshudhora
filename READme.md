Add 2 bread slices in ½ kg mince and chop it in the chopper. Add in 1 egg, 1 tsp mustard powder, some salt, 1 tsp sugar and 1 tbsp corn flour. Mix everything and make kebab out of it. When kebabs are golden brown take them out in the dish. Grease the pan and toast the buns. Spread milk, mayonnaise and butter on the buns and keep the chicken patties on it. Cover it with the other side of the bun. Serve burgers with ½ cup ketchup and French fries.
